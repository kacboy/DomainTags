# DomainTags

A lightweight [Paper](https://papermc.io/) plugin that assigns **scoreboard tags** and sends **custom messages** to players based on the domain they used to connect.

This lets you:
- Distinguish players joining from different hostnames (e.g. `mc.example.com` vs `mc.alt.com`).
- Automatically add/remove scoreboard tags for command selectors.
- Send domain-specific welcome messages (with clickable links).
- Reload config without restarting the server.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Match player join hostname (`mc.yourdomain.com`) and apply rules.
- Add, remove, or leave tags unchanged depending on the mapping.
- Send per-player commands/messages (supports `%player%` placeholder).
- Supports both simple `domains:` mapping or `rules:` list format.
- `/domaintags reload` command to apply config changes live.
- Debug logging to show exactly what hostnames/rules are applied.
